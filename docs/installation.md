# Installation

1. [Download the latest version from the GitHub release page][1]
2. Close SimHub
3. Run the installer
4. The installer should do most of the heavy lifting for you, including locating
   the correct directory for SimHub. If it hasn't, point the installer at your
   SimHub root (where `SimHubWPF.exe` is located).
5. Follow the rest of the installer's instructions
6. When finished, open SimHub
7. You should be prompted to enable the plugin when SimHub launches, choose "yes"
   and the plugin will now be up and running
